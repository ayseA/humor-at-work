# Humor in a Team: Joke / Not? 

Not necessarily the maker, but a good indicator of a good team is the sense of humor.

A good team—they’re all experts. They each know their craft, their work. They’re good at it. They joke, they communicate.

A humorous team processes, takes, hears everything in a relaxed mode—as it is, for what it is.  That’s how they react. No hidden meanings behind things. Well, if there are any, they know how to dig. They don't hesitate to dig. 
Humor itself is subtle – pops up out of nowhere to make you smile. They are open to things. They communicate. 

Humor doesn’t create communication channels by itself, but sure keeps them well-oiled. You can say a lot of things with humor that you otherwise couldn't. It relieves tension—real or potential. Strengthens team spirit – everyone laughing/smiling at the same thing. Relaxed people work well, and a humorous team is relaxed. Or the other way around—only the relaxed are humorous. A relaxed team is humorous. And only the relaxed can think out-of-the-box.

Inside jokes and in-house terminology bring the team together, boost the spirit. Eight hours a day at work—imagine the difference between a tight, squeezed spirit producing, and a lit-up, relaxed one doing the same work.

Also a matter of confidence. A humorous person is confident enough to joke, to say things cheerfully, and still be taken seriously. Still maintain professionalism. Doesn’t have to stick to by-the-book seriousness to be serious. Takes one to see one.
Subject experts—each respected, and respecting the others’ work—those things are well-sunk into their fabric. They’re beyond it. They comfortably play in the finer, humorous zones. They put a dash of humor into things.

And no—a humorous team is not idle, making irrelevant conversations or wasting time. It’s not a waste of time to joke with one another, drop a line here and there, or spice up the interactions. A humorous team knows this.

So, how do you infuse humor into a team? By just doing it.
Top-down is the easiest, more straightforward way—someone with the exemplar attributes "legitimizing" it  — doing the opening and getting the others rolling it on. Corporate picnics, events parties won't hurt, but aren't necessary. Passing / dropping words here and there in the office are more natural and even better. Humor seamlessly weaving itself into interactions / the fabric of the team. No need for extracurricular add-ons. It’s part of the daily rhythm. Nothing extraordinary is required. A humorous team would know how to inject it in. They have their own ways.
